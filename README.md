# Asset Central: A C++ Stock Management System

## 🌟 Introduction
Asset Central is a powerful command-line application built in C++ to help manage and track inventory.  
It provides a robust system for administrators and staff to handle stock, user accounts, and sales transactions.  
The system uses Excel files for data persistence, making it easy to manage and report on your asset data.

## 📦 Features
- **User Management**: Secure login system with separate roles for administrators and general staff.  
- **Stock Management**:  
  - Add, update, and delete stock items.  
  - View all stock items with detailed information (ID, name, quantity, price).  
  - Search for specific stock items.  
- **Transaction Logging**: Records all sales transactions into a receipt log.  
- **Data Persistence**: Uses the xlnt library to read and write all user, stock, and receipt data to Excel (.xlsx) files.  
- **Clean Interface**: Utilizes the tabulate library to display information in clean, easy-to-read tables on the command line.

## 🛠 Prerequisites
To build and run this project, you will need:  
- A C++ compiler that supports the **C++17 standard** (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).  
- **CMake** (version 3.14 or higher) to handle the build process and dependencies.  
- A compatible operating system (tested on Windows and Linux).  

The project's `CMakeLists.txt` file will automatically download the necessary **xlnt** and **tabulate** libraries.
