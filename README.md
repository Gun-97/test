System
 
🌟
 
Introduction
 
Asset
 
Central
 
is
 
a
 
powerful
 
command-line
 
application
 
built
 
in
 
C++
 
to
 
help
 
manage
 
and
 
track
 
inventory.
 
It
 
provides
 
a
 
robust
 
system
 
for
 
administrators
 
and
 
staff
 
to
 
handle
 
stock,
 
user
 
accounts,
 
and
 
sales
 
transactions.
 
The
 
system
 
uses
 
Excel
 
files
 
for
 
data
 
persistence,
 
making
 
it
 
easy
 
to
 
manage
 
and
 
report
 
on
 
your
 
asset
 
data.
